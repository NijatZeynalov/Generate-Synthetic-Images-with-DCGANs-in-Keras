# Generate Synthetic Images with DCGANs in Keras
In this hands-on project, I learned about Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and built a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) with Keras to generate images of fashionable clothes.  I used the Keras Sequential API with Tensorflow 2 as the backend.

In our GAN setup,  we want to be able to sample from a complex, high-dimensional training distribution of the Fashion MNIST images. However, there is no direct way to sample from this distribution. The solution is to sample from a simpler distribution, such as Gaussian noise. We want the model to use the power of neural networks to learn a transformation from the simple distribution directly to the training distribution that we care about. 

__The GAN consists of two adversarial players: a discriminator and a generator. Weâ€™re going to train the two players jointly in a minimax game theoretic formulation.__

In this project, I focused on two learning objectives:

1. Understand Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs and GANs)

2. Design and train DCGANs using the Keras API in Python
